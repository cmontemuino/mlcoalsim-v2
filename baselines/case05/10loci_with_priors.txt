This example simulates five loci from an autosome and five loci from X-chromosome in a mammal species.
The population analyzed suffered a bottleneck defined in prior 1 after a time defined in prior 2. 
After the bottleneck (time 0.01) the population recover to a size defined by prior 3. 
Finally the population coalesce with the outgrip at time defined in prior 4.
Prior 5 is prior 4 + prior 1 + 0.01.
Every loci has defined a theta value (priors 6-15, here al autosome have the same value and X has the same too) 
but a single recombination value (defined in prior 16).

pop_event: matrix that contains 'npop_events' columns separated by commas, each with 5 values separated by spaces/tabs + 2 vectors: 
	first the number of the event (starting from 0!)
	second and third, the populations implicated in the event (if only one, type the same number twice, if second is negative, split pop).
	Next, the the pop_size of the 'new' pop (relative to N). Warning: the 'new' pop must be the number of the smallest 
		pop number when two pops are implicated.
	Next, the time (in 4N gen) the event occurred. Note that this value is relative to the other events occurred before. 
		First, the time is counted from events from 'nint', then, all the npop_events in sucesive order.
	Finally, indicate the migration vector of the new pop(i) i->rest and the vector rest->i in the correct order, 
		with n values (all n population from starting simulation, and writing 0 to the extinct pop and the diagonal).
	In case split, two events have to be defined: the first event needs pop1 from split and pop2 a negative value (the new pop), 
		factor pop for the current pop and the time of split, and migration vectors for the current pop.
	In case split (cont) second event: pop1=pop2 the new pop, factor pop for the new pop, time (not counted) and the migration 
		vectors for the new pop.
